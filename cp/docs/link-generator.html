        <b>Save this link with custom thumbnails -</b>
        <span>
          Check this box to save the link with a name and custom thumbnail URLs. Saved links can be used to create toplists that display your custom thumbnails instead of trade thumbnails. This is useful for creating promotional toplists with custom graphics that link through your tracking (out.php) to content URLs, skim schemes, or specific trades.
        </span>
        <br />

        <b>Link Name -</b>
        <span>

        <b>Custom Thumbnails -</b>
        <span>
          Enter full URLs to thumbnail images, one per line. Each URL should start with http:// or https://. These images will be displayed in the toplist when using saved links. If no thumbnails are provided, a default "no-thumb" image will be shown.
        </span>
        <br />
      </ul>

      <br />

      <div class="bold">Saved Links and Toplists</div>
      After saving a link with custom thumbnails, you can create a toplist from your saved links by going to Tools &raquo; Manage Saved Links. Select the links to include and click "Generate Toplist URL" to get a URL that displays a toplist with your custom thumbnails. Each thumbnail in the toplist will link through out.php with the saved link's settings (tracking stats), then redirect to the content URL, skim scheme, or trade specified in the link.
